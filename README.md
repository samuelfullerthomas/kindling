# Kindling

## Introduction

This repo was created out of my desire to have an up-to-date basic static React based frontend that I can play around with when I have projects that I'd like to hack on over a weekend. What I don't want to do on the weekend is worry about setting a front end project up for the n-th time.

I had been trying to use services that provide boilerplate static apps, like Gatsby, but I found the majority of them to be too opinionated, too bloated, and too specific in their use cases.

To that end, I made myself this starter app, named it Kindling, and have used it as the basis for my website and several personal projects.

## In the box
Kindling provides setup so that, after download, you can run your the app immediately after installation.

To install, run this command from the terminal in your the repo's root directory:

`make bootstrap`

To start the dev server, run:

`make watch`

To build the bundle for production, run:

`make build`

To run tests, run:

`make test`

To initiate your own git history and eject from kindling, run:

`make eject`

### Decisions made

This app is a `webpack` + `react` app.

Why `react`? No reason other than it's the framework I use at my job and therefore it is the one I am most familiar with.

`webpack` allows us to bundle in dependencies (with import statements or requires) and write modern Javascript that will be transpiled via Babel plugins into ES5.

`babel` transpiles our modern JS code into safe-for-ancient-browsers ES5.

`make` to make running the app easier without obfusicating what I'm doing under the hood (if you've never used Makefiles before, they're really class)

`npm` is being used instead of yarn because npm is good again?

`nvm` instead of system node so that I can specify version.

#### Routing

I'm using `react-router`, a really excellent front end routing library. It's one of the most commonly used routers and one I'm familiar with. Routing in the app is handled in the `index.js` file in the root directory.
I'm using it in conjuction with the `history` package, which I'm storing in the app's state manager in `src/state/atom.js`. You can see an example of changing view using the `history` in `src/state/actions.js`'s `returnToHomepage` action, and use that as a template for transitioning between routes. In the `devServer` config in the  `webpack.config.js` file in the root directory I'm setting the `historyApiFallback` option to  `true` so that I can use the history api when I'm developing. There are only two routes inclued to start with  - the App (homepage) route, and the 404 catchall route.

Please find `react-router`'s documentation here:

https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy

#### State management

`tiny-atom` is a state managment framework written and maintained by [Karolis Narkeviƒçius](https://github.com/KidkArolis). You can see it's setup in the `src/state` folder, and you can see it in action in both the `src/views/App` view and the `src/views/FourOhFour` view.

Check out it's fantastic docs site here:

https://qubitproducts.github.io/tiny-atom/

Why not `redux`? I dislike using `redux`. It bloats so much and makes something that should be intuitive (state managment) into a convuluted mess of files.

#### Linting

I use `standard` for linting, not because it is the best or because I agree with every decision it makes, but because it makes everything `standard`.

Check out the docs here:

https://standardjs.com/rules.html

#### Dist folder

the bundle is built and put in the `dist` foler, which contains an `index.html` file and a `_redirects` file. The redirects file ensures that wherever you're hosting the site, the index.html will always be served regardless of the path in the href (which is what makes routing in SPAs possible). The index.html just requires in the bundle.

#### Deployment

I made this repo to be used explicitly with Netlify, but you can use whatever deployment method you would like.

The reason I use netlify is because it does a lot for you out of the box - it'll watch the repo you have your app in and run you `build` command for you, which means CI is as easy as doing a `git push origin master` or merging in a pull request. It also does fancy stuff like allowing you to deploy branches to your website as subdomains, or to deploy different repos to different subdomains (https://kindling.samthomas.io is an example of the latter).
